# Vim Reflections {(["'` `'"])}

## Description
I wanted to add some additional functionality to Auto Pairs, however the
plug-in does not appear to be maintained or accepting pull requests. Therefore
this plugin is a fork and total rewrite of Auto Pairs. The functionality is
simple, it will automatically insert or delete the reflection of brackets and
quotes.

## Demo

## Tests

In order to run the tests you must install [vader](https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim)

Once vader is installed;

```
:Vader tests/*
```
